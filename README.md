# Neural Network on Life Expectancy Data

This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to analyze and predict from the Life Expectancy dataset.

## Features
Exploratory analysis with pandas.

Data preprocessing with scikit-learn (train/test split, scaling, normalization).

Neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras Sequential API.

Evaluation of model performance on real-world health data.
